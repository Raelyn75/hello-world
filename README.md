# hello-world
first repository
I am a jane of all trades and master of none. I have picked up bits and pieces about coding, I knew html when it was the only language to know if you wanted a web page. I learned a bit about python when I first caught the programming bug a few years ago. Languages in general appeal to my love of learning, but unfortunately having an attention span that bounces around like a flea looking for a circus means I am lucky to still speak English in a way that can be understood.
